# Project Euler #

Herein lies [go][0] implementations of [Project Euler][1] problems.

I make no guarantee as to their algorithmic efficiency nor code quality, though I try to keep
things vaguely sane :-)

If you're going to partake of the crack of Project Euler, I strongly recommend not looking at
these before attempting the problems first yourself.
